# US Traffic Accident Analysis - ALY 6110

## Project Overview
This repository contains the final project for ALY 6110 Data Management and Big Data. The project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of US traffic accidents from February 2016 to March 2023. It aims to identify critical factors contributing to accidents and explore strategies to enhance road safety across the United States.

## Dataset
The dataset encompasses approximately 7.7 million records, detailing aspects such as date, time, location, weather conditions, and road characteristics. Sourced from Kaggle, this dataset serves as a foundational element for our analysis.

## Objectives
- Determine key factors contributing to traffic accidents in various locales.
- Propose effective measures to reduce accident occurrences.
- Examine the correlation between accident severity and environmental factors.
- Identify states with the highest accident rates and peak times for accidents.

## Methodologies
- **Data Acquisition**: Sourced from Kaggle, ensuring a rich dataset for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Rigorous data cleaning to ensure data integrity.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhanced the dataset with additional informative features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Employed various visualization techniques to explore underlying patterns and insights.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Utilized correlation analysis to understand the relationships between different variables.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Applied a Random Forest model to predict accident severity based on various features.

## Key Findings
- High accident rates in populous states like California, Texas, and Florida.
- Peak accident times align with typical commuting hours, indicating potential congestion and rush-hour related factors.
- Weather conditions, particularly temperature and visibility, have a significant impact on accident occurrences.
